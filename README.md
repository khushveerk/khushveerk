#  Presentation of Myntra's Architecture


## Introduction: Setting the Scene

Imagine a bustling marketplace filled with vibrant colors, trendy outfits, and eager shoppers. This is the world of Myntra, one of Indiaâ€™s leading fashion e-commerce platforms. Our mission is to provide a seamless shopping experience that connects millions of users with the latest fashion trends, all from the comfort of their homes. To achieve this, we have built a robust and scalable architecture that ensures our platform is not only user-friendly but also capable of handling the demands of a growing customer base.


## The Journey Begins: User Interaction

Our story starts with the User Deviceâ€”the mobile app or web interface where customers browse through thousands of products. Picture a user scrolling through their favorite styles, discovering new collections, and adding items to their cart. This is where the magic begins, and it all starts with our API Gateway.
